# Overview

I really pushed myself working on this program. I created the classic game Snake. I used to play it on an old Atari system that we had and it 
always stuck with me, so I decided to make my own trying to stick to the game I remember as best as I could. 
To play the game, you first select a difficulty then hit enter. If you hit enter before selecting a difficulty, you play in "practice mode"
which awards no points. Once the game is started the player uses the directional keys to change the snake's direction with the goal of eating the
food that appears randomly on the game board. The goal is to last as long as possible and eat as much food as you can to get the highest score without
crashing into yourself or hitting the edge of the game.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* There is definitely some things that can be simplified and moved around. 
* I would like to add a couple more classes to break the code up better.
* I would like to make the winforms app look better, and give it more of a retro game aesthetic
